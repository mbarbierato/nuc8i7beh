# Intel NUC Model NUC8i7BEH

This repository contains personal work and files, developed and maintained for a successful use with [Clover EFI bootloader](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/) on this specific Intel NUC model. There are **no** ready, pre-packaged EFI solutions provided; instead, the needed configuration and ACPI files are published for those interested in studying the code, while creating their own bootloader configurations.

## Wireless Connectivity

The embedded 802.11ac wireless 9560 chipset [8086:9df0] has been working without issues with [itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) since Mojave. The controller can be enabled in BIOS, and for aesthetic reasons, can be renamed from `Device (CNVW)` to `(WLAN)` via Clover patching. As for the embedded BTLE module, Intel reports it being a Bluetooth 5.1 device, which works in _most_ cases with [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware) since Mojave, too. Both drivers can be loaded through Clover.

## Required BIOS Settings

For the most basic but _required_ BIOS settings, as well as previous firmware releases, see [BIOS](BIOS/) folder.

## Active Configuration

* No CPU ID faking required, power management is native; MSR `0xE2` remains locked;
* External USB 3.0 ports work as expected; using generated `USBPorts.kext`;
* Internal USB 2.0 headers not used; they are disabled in BIOS;
* External USB-C port works for display purposes; special USB-C to miniDP cable used;
* Intel graphics acceleration works as `0x3EA50004` with [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases);
* Analogue audio output works as layout ID `0x03` with [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/releases/);
* Digital audio output works with `FakePCIID.kext` and the HDMI Audio extension;
* Embedded Intel LAN interface works with [IntelMausi](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi/releases);
* Embedded Intel WLAN module works with [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases);
* Embedded Intel BTLE module detected with [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases);
* Integrated SD Card reader is not compatible; it is disabled in BIOS;
* Sleep/Wake both work without issues; see "Power" section in [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool/releases);
* Both NVMe and SSD SATA interfaces work with no effort nor kext needed.

For the complete list of all detected PCI hardware components and their respective addresses via `lspci -nn` command (in Ubuntu, loaded via USB) see [here](Various/lspci-nn.txt). This list was created with all devices enabled in BIOS and is used as a device "map" so that PCI IDs can be detected before tweaking the hardware (and BIOS) to run macOS.

## USB Port Mapping on NUC Chassis

| USB 2.0 Port Name | USB 3.0 Port Name | Hardware Location  | Controller     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| HS01              | SS01              | Front RIGHT socket | Primary XHCI   |
| HS02              | SS02              | Front LEFT socket  | Primary XHCI   |
| HS03              | SS03              | Rear TOP socket    | Primary XHCI   |
| HS04              | SS04              | Rear BOTTOM socket | Primary XHCI   |
| HS10              | N/A               | Internal BTLE port | Primary XHCI   |
| HS01              | SS01              | Rear USB-C socket  | Secondary XHCI |

The above active and working USB ports are listed in Hackintool when the two *internal* (USB 2.0) headers and **Consumer IR** are all _disabled_ in [BIOS](BIOS/) and when **all unused or non-referenced USB ports** are removed. In any other situation, ports such as HS05, HS06, HS07, HS08, HS09, USR1, USR2, SS05 and SS06 may be listed. All ports above are defined in `USBPorts.kext` according to their _electrical_ connector.
